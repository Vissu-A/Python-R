Difference B/W list and tuple
================================
1. list is mutable but, tuple is immutable
2. tuple is more memory efficient than list.

Difference B/W list and set
==============================
1. list can have duplicate elements but, set won't accept duplicate elements
2. set is unordered datatype but, list is ordered datatype.
i.e, elements in set not maintain insertion order, they will be added at random locations in set, when you add a new element order will be changed.
