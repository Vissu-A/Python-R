4,Glencore Experience,Tax Analyst,"Stamford, CT","October 22, 2018","Glencore is a successful physical commodities trader with a main office in New York City.  Promotions from within are not usually available since the department is run in a lean and mean approach.  The income tax department has 3 to 4 professional that are responsible for all income tax related tasks including federal and state return compliance, informational return compliance, tax provisions, tax research and international tax reporting for two companies that repost within the Glencore ownership structure.  Compensation packages are very attractive.Work schedule is 8:30 to 5pm with most of the day made up to meeting, daily compliance work and planning for quarterly provisions.  This work allows for individual knowledge growth and putting an individual stamp of how things are done.  The group reported to the Director of Tax who then reported to the International Tax Director.

9,Toxic work environment with poisonous people,Machine Operator,Mcarthur River Mine,"September 22, 2018","Glencore is a firm believer in casualisation of the work force. Machine operators hired as casuals routinely have the carrot dangled in front of them with the promise of permanent full time positions by managment and superintendents saying 'next year we will put people on the books' year after year, but it never happens, and it never will.The roster is good (even time) but your salary will certainly show how much time you spend not working. Many skilled positions dont crack the 6 figure mark including super (total package) if your town job allowed you to do the hours, you could earn more without spending half your life away from your wife and kids.Every single crew and work group has a purple circle. Putting your head down and doing your work above expectations without complaining, never having time off, never blowing numbers or failing drug tests or never having incidents or near misses does not help your career advancement at all. Merit is solely rewarded on how well the employee gets along with supervisors, superintendents and managers and who they drink with at the wet mess.It is a terrible place to work with poisonous people and a very toxic culture.
